Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thanks for thinking of me for this role!

While I am delighted at [having been offered | being considered for] the position of [position here], I’m terribly sorry to inform you that I must decline, as I cannot in good conscience work at a company as unethical as Palantir.

The following is a list of reasons why I refuse to work for Palantir.

- Palantir is co-founded by Peter Thiel, a notorious venture capitalist known for his support of Donald Trump, his secret takedown of Gawker, and his blatantly right wing and misogynist political views.
- Due to the nature of Palantir's work, everything it does is designed to further the power of the police state, not just in the United States, but worldwide.
- Despite promises that their products are "only used for good", it's well documented a Palantir employee had helped Cambridge Analytica use the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users to develop psychographic profiles of voters, indirectly (or directly, depending on your POV) leading to the election of Donald Trump.
- Peter Thiel is proudly anti-democratic, saying "the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron." and "Most importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible."
- As a company, has actively encouraged disinformation campaigns against liberals and leftists in the US. "In 2010, they proposed a plan to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to run a secret sabotage campaign against the group’s liberal opponents. Hacked emails released by the group Anonymous indicated that Palantir and two other defense contractors pitched outside lawyers for the organization on a plan to snoop on the families of progressive activists, create fake identities to infiltrate left-leaning groups, scrape social media with bots, and plant false information with liberal groups to subsequently discredit them."
- Despite all this, they are supposedly pretty incompetent when it comes to the actual software, being accused more than once of simply re-branding and packaging existing off-the-shelf software to unsuspecting clients.
- As recently as 2016, Palantir had enormous turnover (nearly 20%) and had to announce a 20% company wide pay raise for long term employees. This desperation and the high turnover rate is enough to signal to me that Palantir has a less than ideal work environment.

Again, thank you for reaching out about this opportunity.

Please pass this letter on to your manager.

Best,
[Your Name]
